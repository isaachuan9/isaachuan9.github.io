The knife brand Zhang Xiaoquan recently caused heated discusssions on the Internet because of "can't shoot garlic". Zhang Xiaoquan's official statement has once again aroused complaints from netizens.

At the same time, a video of "Chinese people use knives in the wrong way to cut vegetables" was also picked up by general manager Xia, and was instantly tortured by netizens' comments.

On the contrary, Wang Mazi, a top competitor and old rival of Zhang Xiaoquan, used a kitchen knife to shoot garlic on the Douyin live broadcast on the same day that the incident fermented, and it was broadcast for the whole day. The number of onlookers reached 450,000 and nearly 1000 pieces were sold.

In the live broadcast room, Wang Mazi said, "You can shoot onions, ginger and garlic". It's funny to watch this video because it's a new way to promote products.
