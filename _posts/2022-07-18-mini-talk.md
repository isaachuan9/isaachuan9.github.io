Our privacy should be better protected. But it's quite embarrassing that you just can't do it alone. A young couple was on the way to a mountain, when they passed a gas station, it was convenient for Ms.Miao to go to the bathroom. That was a typical Chinese squat toilet actually. When she looked up, it's surprising to find a piece of transparent glass on the door of the toilet, clear inside and out. She felt so embarrassed.

Then she felt very angry because there was a man standing in front of the door, peeping throught the grass. When she rushed to the door, she found her busband standing outside the door with perverted vivid expression. Ms.Miao hugged her husband, "Fortunately, it was you!"

After the incident was exposed, it caused heated discussions among netizens. After all, bathroom is a very private place, and some people complained online, hoping to improve it as soon as possible.
