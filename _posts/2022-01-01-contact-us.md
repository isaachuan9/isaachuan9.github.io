How often is your sales team making important decisions based on gut feel? Are you sure that deal will close this quarter and was it optimally priced? Are your sales resources allocated properly to drive growth?

您的销售团队做重要决策时是否经常依靠直觉？您确定这笔交易能在本季度以最佳定价达成吗？您的销售资源是否得到了合理分配来拉动销售增长？

when sales organizations make major decisions and plans based on gut feelings, there are costly consequences. One company missed its fourth-quarter forecast by a significant amount and had to reset all quotas for the next year, delaying quota distribution by several weeks. Another sales team relied too heavily on experience and judgment to make pricing decisions for large deals and left millions of dollars on the table. One company failed to leverage its data on relative productivity of sales reps across geographies and inefficiently allocated scarce sales resources to the right growth opportunities.

当销售组织根据直觉制定重要决策和计划时，往往会产生代价不菲的后果。有一家公司与第四季度的预期相差甚远，因此不得不重新调整下一年的所有配额，导致配额分配推迟数周之久。另一支销售团队在为大型交易定价时过于依赖经验和人为判断，造成了数百万美元的损失。还有一家公司没有利用好各地区销售代表之间的相对生产力数据，未能有效地将稀缺销售资源分配给合适的增长机会。

In a world where data is everywhere, too many companies fail to take advantage of the power of data and analytics to fuel sales performance improvement.

这个世界充满了数据，但有太多公司未能利用数据和分析的力量来为销售业绩添砖加瓦。

What could this look like? I’ve seen several use cases where advanced analytics have been applied to sales:

具体效果如何？我见过一些将高级分析应用于销售的用例：

- __Improved pricing and discounting:__ Many sales reps and leaders are time-constrained and haven’t been trained to effectively apply data analytics to pricing decisions. Oftentimes, it’s faster and easier to just offer the same pricing to customers or use the floor of the discount matrix to speed up the customer buying process. Typically, sales reps don’t know that other reps in their organization have achieved higher prices for the same deals with similar customers. This is an area where data and analytics can yield several points of margin improvement. With an advanced analytics platform mining all historical sales data, sales leaders can see where they are pursuing suboptimal pricing and challenge sales teams to reconsider their deal structures.

- __优化定价和折扣：__ 许多销售代表和领导都受制于时间，且没有接受过相关培训，无法将数据分析有效应用于定价决策。通常情况下，一种更为快速而简单的做法是向客户提供相同的定价，或运用向下取整后的折扣矩阵，从而加快客户购买流程。通常，销售代表不知道组织中的其他代表为相同的交易与同类客户谈成了更高的价格。但如果利用数据和分析，利润率就可以得到显著提升。通过采用先进的分析平台挖掘所有历史销售数据，销售领导们就能清楚地看到，他们在哪些情况下追求了次优价格并让销售团队不得不重新考虑交易结构。
  
- __Better forecasting accuracy:__ Sales leader judgment can be an important ingredient in forecasting deals, but human judgment often fares far worse than analytical models in assessing the likely outcome of deals and sales teams. The data does not lie. By leveraging data points on opportunities (e.g., the customer’s historic buying behavior, sales rep performance, product type, and sales stage), a predictive model can actually deliver a more accurate forecast than traditional “roll-up” processes can. Using these types of analytical models can also save countless hours in management meetings trying to analyze human judgment and adding “manager overrides” to lower-level forecasts.

- __提高预测的准确性：__ 销售主管的判断是预测交易的重要因素，但在评估可能的交易结果和销售团队业绩时，人为判断的准确性往往比分析模型差得多。数据不会说慌。预测模型利用数据点（例如客户的历史购买行为、销售代表的绩效、产品类型及销售阶段）来分析各种销售机会，准确率实际上高于传统的自下而上式“汇总”流程。管理层经常召开会议来分析人为判断，并试图加入管理层的决断，否定低层级人员的部分预测。而通过上述分析模型则可以避免这类会议，从而节省大量时间。
  
- __Reduced customer churn:__ Armed with a comprehensive profile of customer behaviors (e.g., support incidents, attendance at training classes, and website engagement), sales reps and/or customer success managers can more accurately identify at-risk customers and take preventative actions to prevent churn. Marketing outreach can also be tailored to target at-risk customers and increase overall engagement.

- __减少客户流失：__ 通过全面了解客户行为的特征（例如支持事件、培训课程参加情况和网站互动情况），销售代表和/或客户成功经理可以更准确地识别出不稳定的客户，然后采取预防措施来防止客户流失。同时还可以为这些不稳定客户定制营销推广活动，提高他们的整体互动度。
