Well, the copycat approach is know as Shanzhai, which originally used to describe a bandit stronghold outside goverment control. In today's slang, it refers to businesses based on fake or pirated products.

It's reported that China is the top distributor of fake shoes, clothing, electronics, and other goods. Actually, pirated goods are considered illegal and are against international intellectual property laws. But the market for counterfeit goods continues to thrive.

If you are interested in any kind of electronics, from cell phones to high-tech drones, the capital of Shanzhai is where you can go. The workers there often extremely talented. They can assemble even a fully functional android if needed.

I think we should be aware of innovations coming from China. Some brands rooted in this culture have become world famous. Is copycat culture good? Leave your comment below.
